== Chapter III. The State of Man in the Separation

When man had transgressed and sinned against the power and wisdom of God,
and was driven out of paradise, and barred from the Tree of Life,
he then became a servant to deceitful subtlety, and followed its leadings downward,
becoming a wanderer in the earth,
where the serpent led him into dark corners and in dry paths.
And so being joined to the serpent, he became an enemy to God,
filled with the serpent`'s cruelty and enmity against everything that was good.
Then the treacherous enemy worked by deceptions and enticing temptations
to keep man under that dominion into which he had drawn him;
so that whenever anything arose in man and longed after the Lord,
the enemy stood ready with his devouring mouth to swallow it up and destroy it.
And having gained dominion over man, he made him bow at his will,
and with his subtle working he keeps him in the earthly
habitations and worldly paths into which he has drawn him,
and there holds him in separation from the God that made him,
leading him about in the dark imaginations of the earthly part.
Here he begets and generates things that are evil and sinful,
so that man becomes deformed, having lost that pure image in which he was created.
Indeed, he has turned into the serpent`'s beastly nature,
and is actuated and ordered by his unclean spirit,
which brings forth deeds of darkness and leads man to commit sin with greediness.

Thus man lost the authority in which he once ruled over the creation,
and has fallen under the power of darkness.
The serpent has weakened him and set the creation over him,
leading him to commit evil in his use of the creation.
And because man`'s heart has run into the earth and become subject to it,
he is taken captive by it at the will of the serpent.
And so it is that drunkenness and gluttony, pride and covetousness,
have come to rule over man.
The devil holds him captive in these things,
and he neither knows how much to eat or drink, or what to wear,
nor how much earthly substance he should desire,
for the serpent has so drawn his heart to lust after evil that he is always desiring,
but never satisfied.
And even when man has received from the creation what is sufficient for his present need,
yet he lusts to receive more.
His lustful desires press him steadily,
so that he is never content with as much as is needful.
Thus when a man eats and drinks what he needs and is refreshed,
still the lust is not satisfied, and the devil provokes the will to press after more;
and when man gives way to the lust, and so follows the lust,
he follows the devil who is the father of it, and therein he serves the devil.
And so, being overcome with lust, he remains in bondage to it.
His will moves forward in fleshly liberty, and the enemy hurries him on into excess,
knowing that his lust will not be satisfied until he has received so much of
the creation as to deprive him of the right use of his natural faculties,
and turn him wholly into the serpents beastly nature,
who in that state rejoices over him.

Here the devil has his dominion,
having brought man both under his power and under the creation,
which man formerly had dominion over.
So now the heart lusts after drinking until a man is drunk,
and after eating until a man is glutted.
And finding the mind of man directed downward,
Satan leads it into the lowest parts of the earth,
and there generates even more lustful desires after earthly things.
Thus man yearns after the earth, and after the profits that arise from it;
and as these do increase, so the heart is more in love with them,
and the lust eagerly pursues more and more enjoyment.
The devil persuades him that he has not yet gained enough of such things that he needs,
and when he at last obtains one thing,
then the devil has another ready to present to him.
So man thirsts after this new thing, and longs eagerly to enjoy it;
and so there is no end of his lustful desire.

From here arises all deceit, fraud and cheating,
for this covetous desire always watches for ways to gain for itself,
and to get some advantage.
So that one man defrauds another, and men cheat and beguile one another,
because the lustful desires (in which the devil works) covet after unlawful gain.
They desire to be rich, to be esteemed among men,
to be set up in honor and dignity in the world, etc.
And when a man comes to be preferred above others, yet he is still not content,
but lusts after greater honor, dignity, and promotion.
Here men come into that honor that is from below,
but do not understand the honor which is of God,
and so they become like the beasts that perish;
for the honor from below only puffs up the man, and exalts him in the pride of his heart.
And as his earthly substance increases, so he gains greater esteem and honor amongst men,
so that the rich are preferred, and the poor are scorned and despised.
And if such a man is not given the honor he expects (in bowing, and flattering,
and putting off the hat) then the devil turns his lust into anger, envy, malice, hatred,
cruelty, revenge, and evil-will.

All this is the work of the devil,
where man (in the separation from God) is found willing and lusting
and striving after riches and honor and worldly glory,
seeking to be the greatest, climbing up higher and higher that he may rule over others,
and expecting subjection from all to his power.
But neither he that rules, nor they that are ruled over, are content with their places,
but strife continues concerning who should be greatest.
And from here come wars and contentions, with men destroying and killing one another;
for the devil rules through lust, provoking anger, malice and revenge.
Alas, the devil has generated a kingdom of darkness in man,
and there establishes himself as prince, and holds rule over man in his subtlety.
Whatever he wills is performed through lust,
and under his power man is captivated and commits many evils.

This was not the condition of man in the beginning, but the serpent has deformed him,
and has begotten many lustful desires in him,
so that he eagerly thirsts after the visible part of the creation.
He has lost his union with the pure power and wisdom of God in which he was created,
and has gone into corruptible things to bring forth corruptible deeds.
These press upon the pure creation of God, and keep it in bondage,
and daily increase the weight that is upon it,
so that all creation groans in sore travail and pain,
for the devil and his work have risen up and spread over it.
Thus covetousness, drunkenness, gluttony, pride, envy, malice, wrath, anger, evil-will,
deceit, fraud, guile, truce-breaking, false-accusing, high-mindedness, foolish jesting,
idle talking, vain communication, scorning, reproaching, reviling, man-pleasing,
delighting in sports and pleasures and pastimes--these have become the very life of man,
and his delight is daily in them.
And these do separate him from the enjoyment of the pure God that made him,
who in His wisdom made all things good.
There were no such things brought forth in God`'s pure creation,
but all of this has been begotten by the serpent`'s begetting through man`'s degeneration.
All has arisen since the beginning through the devil`'s subtle working,
for he is the father of these things.
And all whose life is in these things, or whose delight is after them,
they are his children, and are separated from God, and alienated from His Life.
These cannot taste His good things,
because the streams of God`'s pure refreshing are dammed up,
so that they cannot flow in their proper course through the veins of the pure creation,
to make alive the inner man and to raise it up.
Alas, the old man with his deeds stops the flow.
Adam is there in the way,
obstructing the free course of the invisible love and life of the Creator,
in which man had his communion and satisfaction before transgression.
