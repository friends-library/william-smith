[short="Chapter VIII -- The New Birth in the Regeneration"]
== Chapter VIII. The New Birth in the Regeneration, and also the Serpents Working

Man, having degenerated from the holy order of the pure creation,
and having fallen under the serpent`'s power (who is a subtle and deceitful worker),
all of his faculties and properties are now in a state of disorder, chaos, and confusion,
and unless he is regenerated and born again he cannot come again to the place
where he stood in the pure creation and enjoyed the presence of the pure God;
nor can he come to the Tree of Life, but is shut out and stopped by the flaming sword.
For that which is unclean cannot enter into that which is pure,
nor can it come near to feed upon the holy Life,
but must be cut down and consumed with the sword,
and man must pass through the fiery furnace before
he can inherit the kingdom or possess eternal life.
For this reason, the Light is given to discover all of man`'s ways,
that he might return and again possess the Life from which he has degenerated and fallen.
With this Light he is convinced in his own conscience of
the things that are evil so that he will not abide in them,
but rather forsake them, deny them, and follow the Light out of them.
And as man comes into obedience to the Light of Christ,
he comes to know that which both convinces him of sin,
and is sufficient to save him from sin, and redeem him out of sin,
destroying the body of sin,
and restoring him to the holy order of the pure creation where he once
enjoyed the presence of God and was "`good`" in the sight of God.

It is this same Light which seeks all lost men,
and is made manifest to save and redeem them out of their lost condition.
And all who have believed in it, through many ages and generations,
have known the effectual working of its power by
which they have been redeemed out of the earth,
and from the vain conduct of the world,
and have walked as pilgrims and strangers in the world.
This pure light was with Abel, and in it he sacrificed, and his sacrifice was accepted.
It was with Seth, and in it he called upon the name of the Lord.^
footnote:[Genesis 4:26]
It was with Noah,
and in it he was preserved when the flood came upon the world of the ungodly.
It was with Abraham, and he believed, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
It was with Isaac, and in it he became heir of the promise.
It was with Jacob, and in it he overcame the mount of Esau.
It was with Moses, and in it he led the inheritance of God out of Egypt.
It was with David and in it his kingdom was exalted.
It was with Job, and in it he was redeemed, and knew that his Redeemer lived.
It was with Isaiah, and in it he saw the Child that was born and the Son that was given.
It was with John the Baptist,
and in it he saw the Lamb of God and beheld the glory
of the only begotten of the Father.

This pure Light of the holy Seed of Christ has had its course through all generations,
and has been made manifest through various dispensations
and administrations as it has pleased the Father of spirits.
And as men have believed in it, they did not abide in darkness,
or continue satisfying the lustful desires of the fleshly part,
but were regenerated through the effectual working of its
power whereby they became dead to sin and alive to God.
By it they were born of the holy Seed, which made them holy men,
and with it they were filled and divinely inspired,
and testified for the Lord in its power.
It was the same Light made manifest in all of them,
and it never changed its quality or property,
though it manifested itself in various ways.
And all the holy men that gave forth the Scriptures
had the name and nature of this holy Seed,
and were born of it through regeneration.
Indeed this was a work wrought in men before the Scriptures were written,
and was the same work wrought in those who wrote the Scriptures,
and has been the same in all generations since the Scriptures were written.
This is the work of Christ, the holy Seed,
and it belongs to Him alone to regenerate and to make a new man,
for no man can add to the work of regeneration,
it being an inward work wrought by an invisible power.

And there is a remnant who truly witnesses this work in this day,
whom the Lord has chosen to be His own peculiar people.
For as a man turns to the Light of Christ in his own conscience,
it opens to him his condition, manifests every secret thing,
and shows all that the serpent has begotten and drawn his life into,
clearly making known to the understanding that these things are evil and sinful.
And as man heeds the Light and obeys it,
it leads out of the evil that it has made manifest unto him,
and thus far a man is both convinced and converted.
And though the serpent makes war,
and labors to hold men in those things which he has begotten in him,
yet so long as a man will join his will to the Light,
he will receive strength to stand against him, and also to overcome him.
But after a man is convinced, converted, and turned to the Light,
he then enters into a great fight of afflictions,
and must pass through many a sore conflict before he can get the serpent under his feet.
And after conversion, the serpent assails him even more,
and labors to stop him in his travel,
so that men are sometimes kept by the subtle workings of Satan and cannot move on,
nor cast off those things that they desire to turn from in obedience to the light.
And the way that the serpent does this is by drawing man into reasoning and consulting,
and so to consider what will happen if he turns from, gives up,
and departs from those things which he is convinced to be evil.
Here many have felt the dragon`'s war against the innocent Lamb who travails
for freedom from those corruptible things that have oppressed the innocent Life.
And if a man hearkens to the serpent, and enters into such reasonings,
the veil remains over him, and he sees nothing but great loss in turning from all evil;
and under this veil many stumble at the Light, draw back and follow it no further,
though for a time they have been obedient in some things.
This is the man who loves something more than Christ,
and cannot part with his own life in order to gain life eternal.

Thus the old serpent works for the safety of his kingdom,
and yet many have broken his strongholds and been
loosed from his bonds by the power of the light,
which, when minded and obeyed, turns the mind from the things that are evil,
arises in power to judge them, and crucifies them upon the cross.
In this way man dies to the evil, and the evil dies in man.
As for instance, when a drunkard minds the Light, and obeys the Light,
it first convinces him that drunkenness is a sin, then leads him out of it,
destroys that work of darkness, and takes man`'s life away from it.
This is the work of Jesus Christ, who is made manifest to destroy the works of the devil,
and to burn them up with unquenchable fire,
so that man may thereby be set free from under the burden of corruption.
And whatever the serpent has generated in man since the beginning,
and drawn man`'s heart to lust after and delight in,
the Light which was in the beginning (and in which there is no sin,
being pure and undefiled) appears against it to bring
it down with a stroke of severe judgment.
And so long as man believes in the Light, so it continues to work,
appearing in power to destroy every lust whereby the serpent
has dominion over man and makes war with his soul.
And as man denies himself, takes up his cross, and follows the light faithfully,
he thereby "`dies daily,`" (1 Cor. 15:31) and the power
makes a separation between the precious and the vile,
and so he comes to know the One whose fan is in His hand,
and whose fire will be felt to burn up all the chaff.

Now, so long as a man abides faithful in this day, and keeps in the righteous judgment,
the old man will be crucified, and all of his deeds consumed,
so that neither open profaneness nor an outward show of godliness shall stand,
but all that is lofty will come down, and even the strongest of enemies will bow.
For this fire will not spare, but will pass through all the earthly properties,
and all that is of the earth must burn.
And if man will only abide steadfast in this day, and keep in the patience,
then "`judgment will be brought forth unto victory`" (Matt. 12:20)
and man will come forth dead to himself and alive in Christ,
experiencing how the Light does not only show him his sin, and convince him of it,
but if he turns, obeys, and believes, so it takes sin away,
and purges the conscience from dead works,
and redeems out of all the lusts that the serpent has generate within.
Here man knows for certain that "`his Redeemer lives,`" and salvation
is experienced in the Light that condemns all sin in the flesh.

In this way the drunkard is redeemed out of drunkenness, the swearer from swearing,
the liar from lying, the covetous man from covetousness, and angry man from anger,
and all are redeemed from vain pleasures, games, joking, wildness, stubbornness, customs,
fashions and traditions that are in the world through lust.
For the Light searches and finds out every secret thing of the old lustful nature,
and brings it to judgment, so that there is nowhere for the serpent to escape,
but the judgment falls on his head.
And though it may be long before a man can truly give himself
up to deny all things that he is convinced to be evil,
or before he can get clearly through the wilderness,
or witness a perfect regeneration through the fire of cleansing; yet,
so long as man believes in the Light and follows it, the work is going on and prospering,
the lusts and evil deeds are dying, and the serpent is weakening,
so that he does not come upon man so furiously and forcibly as before.
Indeed, his temptations are weaker, and the man in the Light grows stronger,
and stands with courage to resist him.
And as man feels dominion at any time over the serpent,
and that he is able (as he abides in the Light) to resist him,
so his strength and courage increase, and he stands boldly in the day of battle,
not yielding when temptations come, but bringing them under and treading them down.
And when the serpent appears to tempt man into the lust that he is making war against,
he stands prepared, and goes forth against him in his first appearance,
placing true judgment upon his head, and bruising him in the power of the Light.

For this is the great design of the serpent: to keep man alive to himself,
to delight in the lusts of his own heart, whereby the enemy maintains his rule over him,
and takes him captive according to his will.
And for this reason,
many temptations come upon a man after he is convinced
and comes to acknowledge the truth of God.
And as he is converted and turned to the Lord,
he is many times sorely beset along the way, and often almost driven back again.
From here arises the great and strong warfare that
a man encounters in his spiritual travel,
finding it hard work to come to a regenerated state; for he must deny himself,
forsake his heart`'s lusts, lay down his life, and abide the fire of judgment.
And in this journey the two contrary natures are felt to be in strife,
and the gate is found to be narrow, and few there are who find it.
But as a man stands faithful and abides in the Light,
he grows in strength and learns to stand when the enemy thus violently pursues him,
and at last he will stand a conqueror over all the
lusts that once had dominion over him.

But when the serpent finds that he cannot hold man in his inordinate affections,
nor lead him forth to satisfy his lusts to the full as he formerly did,
he then in subtlety abates the temptation,
and persuades man that he may use things moderately, and only keep out of the excess;
saying it is only excess that makes something evil and to be condemned.
So he tells the drunkard, that he may drink moderately,
keep his friends company and be merry with them.
And he says to the proud in heart,
that he may dress handsomely according to his standing in society,
if only he keeps out of excess; and many other temptations the serpent has,
insisting that the moderate use of things will not bring condemnation.
But here many have found him to be a liar;
for when they came down from excess into that which the devil calls moderation,
there they found themselves still feeding the lusts of their heart,
and being condemned and judged by the Light in their heart.
And these could find no rest or peace until the devil was wholly denied,
and the heart`'s lust was given up to the cross to be crucified,
and thereby redemption is perfectly wrought in the heart by the power of Christ.
And only then do these find the proper use of all things,
and their proper place in the true moderation.
For those who are truly redeemed can use the creation without condemnation,
receiving and using all things in the fear of the Lord,
according to what is useful and no more; for lust no longer reigns in the heart,
nor reaches out beyond the present need.

And now to share one true and faithful experience, though many might be mentioned:
I know a man who once was alive to himself, and served his lusts,
and loved his pleasures more than God.
And there was one thing in particular wherein the
serpent had taught him to find his life,
and his delight was chiefly in it.
And after he came to obey the Light of Christ in his conscience,
this thing was clearly shown him to be exceedingly evil.
And though he minded the Light and stood in the cross to this lustful desire,
yet the devil did not cease to provoke him strongly to satisfy the lust.
And for a time the terror of the Lord was upon him,
and His righteous judgment reached unto him,
and many stripes were laid upon him for the evil.
But then the serpent said, "`You must only lessen your inordinate affection,
and then it will not be so with you.`"
So the man ceased using much of this thing, and began to use less,
until it was hardly used at all, but still the judgment of the Lord pursued him,
and terror increased upon him, and it was just for the Holy God to do so.
And so he could find no peace until he gave up his life in the lust,
and learned to stand upon his watch,
so that whenever the serpent approached with that temptation,
judgment was placed upon his head.
Thus the man learned so to walk in the daily cross, until he was crucified to the lust,
and the lust was crucified to him, and it is now as dead as if it had never been;
glory be unto the Lord forever more, who undertook the case and perfected His own work.

But the man who comes not to experience the lust crucified
in its very root and ground is betrayed into a false moderation,
and standing there,
he looks at himself to be above many others who still abide in inordinate affection.
Thus the serpent works cunningly to keep man out of the furnace,
and to lead him far from judgment; and although the inordinate affection may lessen,
yet the lust is not crucified and the life in the lust is saved.
In this way man flees for his life,
and instead of denying himself and taking up the cross,
he rather denies the cross to save himself,
fleeing from judgment and seeking to hide from the light of the Day.

But as man keeps to the Light, the way is made easier,
and he will be enabled to tread through it and come to the end of it,
and conquer the serpent that works against him.
And as man follows the light faithfully, it not only brings him to the judgment,
but it keeps him in the judgment,
and there he learns to wait until "`judgment is brought forth unto victory.`"^
footnote:[Matthew 12:20]
And as he remains willing, and keeps under the daily cross,
cheerfully giving up all his heart`'s lusts to be crucified,
he will come to feel the enmity slain that has begotten and nourished the lust.
For as a man comes through the furnace and abides
the fire of refinement in which a separation is made,
and the corruptible is burned and destroyed, then the holy Seed appears without mixture,
and the creation is delivered from travail and pain.
And it is in this fiery furnace that a man is regenerated, and the old man is destroyed,
and the lusts of his heart crucified, and the body of sin consumed,
and the dross and tin are separated from the gold.
It is through this living operation or working that man is recovered out of the fall,
and the pure creation is again restored to its holy order,
and man is redeemed out of the fallen properties where he lusts after evil,
and comes again to the paradise of God and the Tree of Life,
finding that the flaming sword no longer keeps him out.
This is the regeneration which man must come to experience in the fire of refinement,
where he must part with all that is his own (both his filthiness and righteousness)
and pass through without holding any unclean thing,
or he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
For man must put off the corruptible part where he abides in the degeneration,
before he can be restored to the holy order of the pure creation.
And as he puts off the old man in the refining fire,
and abides in the work of regeneration, he comes to the new, and the new is born in him,
and a change is wrought whereby he is redeemed out of the
fallen properties into the holy order of the Life.
Then he is no longer his own, nor can he satisfy his lusts any longer,
but is truly dead to them, and his life is renewed in the birth of the holy seed,
of which he has been born.
Thus he puts off drunkenness and dies to that lust, puts on sobriety,
and lives in Christ`'s virtue.
Or he puts off anger and dies to that lust, puts on meekness,
and lives in Christ`'s virtue.
He puts off envy and dies to that lust, puts on love, and lives in Christ virtue.
And so everything that the serpent has begotten through his deceitful
working and that stands in the old lustful nature is judged by the light,
and crucified by the power, and consumed in the fire,
and so he is cleansed from all defilements so that
the way is clear for the holy Birth to spring up,
and for the Lamb who was slain to reign.
And thus it can be truly said that "`to die is gain,`"
and "`blessed is the man who dies in the Lord`",
for he comes to inherit life and immortality,
and to possess durable riches and life without end,
being an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, in whom he is made a new man,
bearing the heavenly image in which the Father is glorified.
