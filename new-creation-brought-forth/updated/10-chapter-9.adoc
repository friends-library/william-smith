== Chapter IX. The New Creation in the Holy Order

So the Lord God of eternal glory searches after man in his fallen and degenerated state,
and with His pure Light He finds him far off,
with his feet walking in paths of darkness in the land of desolation,
and there He visits him in his poor and low condition.
For man has fallen from God, and departed from his Maker.
The serpent has deceived him,
and with his subtlety has drawn him out of the holy order and enticed
his mind into the fallen properties of the visible part of creation,
where he becomes a servant to the subtle deceiver,
satisfying the lusts of his own fleshly heart, and sinning against the holy God.
And in this disorder of the unruly affections,
the pure creation remains in bondage and travails in many pains,
and the old heavens and old earth are over it and heavily oppress it.
And in this fallen state man is never at rest,
nor is his heart ever satisfied with his lusting,
but he lives separated from the God of mercy and plunged into the depth of misery.
Alas, he is a sinner, and death reigns over him, and wrath is upon him,
and in the disorder of his unruly affections his
life is driven about and tossed to and fro,
and there is no steadfastness in him.

But in this troubled state, a cry is raised unto the Lord,
and a breathing goes forth to find true rest, and the Lord hears,
and in great pity arises to help, stretches forth His arm,
and brings many mountains down.
He comes forth in His power and makes the hills to melt.
He utters His voice and the earth trembles,
kindling a fire that consumes the earthly part to ashes.
Thus he brings man into nothingness, and dissolves the firth birth into dust,
and causes the old heavens to pass away with a shout,
melting the elements with fervent heat.
And thus man no longer finds his life in such things,
but that life is taken away and he is slain and dead,
until the Spirit of Life from God comes upon Him
to create Him anew in the holy order of life,
giving him breath and a being as he had in the beginning.

For he is newly made and fashioned by the hand of God, and is His workmanship,
in whom he now receives his life, and from whose Spirit he draws his breath,
and so is perfectly renewed in the spirit of his mind, having no old things upon him,
nor earthly parts abiding in him.
Yes, through the fire of refinement he is made clean,
and springs forth out of the virgin`'s womb,
and drinks from the breasts which give true life, whereby he grows in strength,
increases in wisdom, and comes into the stature of the fullness of Christ,
as a partaker of the divine nature.
Thus all old things are done away and put off in the fire of refinement,
and he comes forth from the furnace as a naked child, a new creation,
to rise up with the Lamb in His nature,
to be clothed with the glory of the precious pearl,
and restored into the holy order of Life.
Here his food is from the Tree of Life,
and his movement stands in the power and wisdom of the Seed which has come into dominion,
and now reigns in purity without any mixture.

But it is only as man abides the fire, and waits in the judgment,
that he puts off the old things in which he has lived, and puts on the new,
being translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love.
For as a man believes in the Light made manifest
in his conscience (which shines forth from the Life),
so he comes to the righteousness of God, who passes sentence against him,
condemns him to death, and crucifies him upon the cross.
In this way man truly dies to himself, with all his heart`'s lusts both in thought, word,
and deed, and receives Christ the Seed of new life, learns to put Him on,
and feels Christ made unto him wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.
Thus he passes through the six days of work, where all dross is consumed in the furnace,
and comes to the seventh day where he rests with God from all his own works,
and sits down in the power and wisdom of the holy Seed,
reposing in the stillness of the divine nature and in the holy order of the new creation.
In this way the new creation is finished with all of its hosts,
being brought into the holy order by the effectual working of the holy power.
Indeed man is hereby changed and renewed by the holy birth of the immortal Seed,
and placed again in the paradise of God, no longer kept out by the flaming sword,
but having daily access to the Tree of Eternal Life.
