== A New Catechism

[.discourse-part]
Question: How does God manifest Himself unto man,
so that a man may know Him to be what He really is?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By opening Himself in His love, whereby His own light breaks forth from Himself,
and in this light He manifests Himself unto man, showing what He is.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is the light by which God manifests Himself unto man?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: That light is Christ, who is one with God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is the light of Christ one with God in nature?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for God is light, and the light is one with His nature.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How does Christ manifest the nature of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: In His light and life, in which He is the brightness of the Father`'s glory,
and the express image of His person.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Where is such a manifestation of God to be known?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It is to be known within man.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Does God indeed manifest Himself within man?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, and man cannot know Him by any other way,
except by the manifestation of Himself in His light within him.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does every man experience such a light within him,
by which God does manifest Himself unto him?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for every man that comes into the world is enlightened by Christ,
as John bears witness: "`He was the true Light,
which gives light to every man coming into the world.`"
John 1:9

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is there not another way to come to the knowledge of God,
but by this light within?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, there is not, for Christ is the light, and Christ is the way,
and all other ways lead away from God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How may it be known for certain that this light comes from God,
and that God manifests Himself in it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Because the light is pure, holy, just and righteous, which is the nature of God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how does a man know that this light is of a pure and righteous nature?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Because it checks, convinces, and reproves for sin, and for every evil thought,
word, and work, that man, in his fallen condition, has love unto and pleasure in.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Do you mean that that which disquiets and reproves a man in his conscience for sin,
is the true light of Christ?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes,
for there is nothing else within man that will check or reprove him for sin and evil.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But could it not be some part of man`'s natural faculties
or constitution that reveals sin and evil,
so as to convince and reprove him for it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: This light is natural to Christ,
but it is not natural to man in his fallen condition, for there his nature is corrupted,
and the powers of darkness have dominion over him,
and thus a man`'s natural constitution is that nature
in and by which sin and evil is committed.
The nature which commits sin, will never convince or reprove for sin; for if it were so,
it would be divided against itself.
It consequently must be the light of Christ which convinces and reproves for sin,
because in Christ there is no sin, and all sin is committed in another nature,
and is against Him.
So it is the natural light of Christ that reproves the natural man in the fall.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But has man at any time truly known God as He is God,
by this light that is within him?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for the Apostle said, "`The light which shines in our hearts,
gives us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,
in the face of Jesus Christ,`" and so He has been known, and is known,
according to the measure of the light of Christ within man.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And is there anything in man that is of a contrary nature to the light,
which does oppose it, and by which man is veiled from the knowledge of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, there is darkness in man, in which the seed of enmity lodges,
which does oppose the light, and veils man from the knowledge of God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: In what ways are darkness and light in opposition to one another?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: In their contrary workings, and according to their opposing natures.
For darkness comes from and leads to that which is evil,
and the light comes from and leads to that which is good,
and thus they oppose one another.
So that when the darkness works unto sin, the light reproves it;
and when the light works unto good, the darkness opposes it in enmity.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But if the light appears in all men, and would bring all men unto good,
how then shall we understand the doctrine of election and reprobation?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The election and reprobation stand in the two natures or seeds of light and darkness.
The one is elected, and the other condemned.
For the seed of light is Christ,
whom God has elected and chosen before the foundation of the world;
and the seed of darkness is the devil,
and here is the enmity with God that is reprobated forever.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Did Jacob and Esau signify the nature of these contrary
seeds in which the election and reprobation stand?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, they did, for Jacob signified the spiritual seed of Abraham,
the father of the faithful, unto whom God sealed the covenant with His seed forever.
But Esau signified the seed of enmity, the birth of flesh,
which is out of God`'s covenant and is reprobate.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How did Jacob and Esau stand in the sight of God while they were in the womb,
seeing that it says, before they were born, or had done either good or evil,
Jacob was loved of God, and Esau hated?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: This speaks of the natures or seeds in which each birth is conceived.
Though both were in Rebekah`'s womb, yet the one was of flesh, the other of Spirit;
and so it is in man.
Esau is of flesh, and is outside of God`'s covenant; Jacob is the true Seed,
and the covenant is in Him.
Thus God beholds the seeds in the womb before they have done either good or evil.
Jacob is in the election, and is loved of God; Esau is in the reprobation,
and is hated of God, that God`'s own purpose according to the election might stand.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And have these natures or seeds been in man throughout all generations?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, they have.
And here has been the true warfare, nation against nation (so to speak) within man,
in the natures of the two seeds.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What then is the state and condition of people that remain in the fall,
and abide in transgression?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: A state of trouble and vexation of spirit.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
What dispensations must people pass through in order to come unto peace and rest in God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: They must pass through the dispensation of the Law and the Prophets,
unto Christ the substance, in whom is the rest and eternal peace.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is the Law in itself?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It is the nature of God described and required, being in itself holy, spiritual,
just and good.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is not that which is holy, spiritual, just and good,
a dispensation in which peace and rest can be enjoyed?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, as it comes to be fulfilled by Christ.
But it is not so to those who are in the flesh.
For the written Law makes nothing perfect, and there can be no true rest and peace,
but in that Spirit which is perfect and which makes perfect.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What then does the administration of the Law serve unto,
if it makes nothing perfect?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It serves as a schoolmaster to bring unto Christ.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How is it like a schoolmaster in its administration?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Both in correcting and judging the transgressor,
and in instructing and teaching in righteousness;
for the Law was added to the covenant of faith because of transgression.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Is not Christ also made manifest through both the dispensations of the Law and the Prophets?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: He is so, but darkly as in a glass,
according to that dispensation unto which these serve.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
How then must the Law and the Prophets be passed through
in order to come unto Christ who fulfills them.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By seeking to observe the statutes and ordinances that are therein contained,
whereby there is first the condemnation of the transgressing nature,
and then a reaching forward to the more full enjoyment of the perfection of Christ,
who fulfills the Law and the Prophets in the more
glorious appearance of His own life and fullness.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is the administration of the Law in force in this present age?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, it remains in force to take hold upon all transgressors,
and it is ministered in justice against the transgressing nature,
which errs from the statutes and ordinances that are therein contained.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But are not people in this age under a Gospel administration?
And are they now to be brought back again under the Law?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: They who have not passed through the administration of the Law in themselves,
are not under a Gospel administration,
and therefore they cannot be said to be "`brought
back again,`" because they never went forward.
Rather, they are to be brought _into_ that which they have hitherto not known or understood.
For a Gospel administration simply professed with words will not do people any good,
and so it is that many in this age pass over the Law as
an administration below their Christian profession,
alleging that the Law was a more proper administration in ages past,
and more particularly to the Jews,
not understanding that it has its proper administration
in man as long as sin and transgression remain in him.
Thus it is in as full force in this age upon all transgression,
as ever it was in ages past; for judgement takes hold of man to correct the guilty,
and God will by no means clear the guilty.

[.discourse-part]
Question: So is there a throne of judgement set up under the Law,
to judge and condemn the transgressors of the Law?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, it is so, that every man might fear the Lord God,
who gives forth His Law in man to be kept and not to be broken.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is it possible for a man to keep the Law in all things,
and not offend in anything, performing the requirings of God under that dispensation?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: If it were not possible on man`'s part to keep it,
then it would seem hard that the Lord should command and require it,
and then judge and condemn for breaking it.
And even in ages past,
there were some who were said to walk before the Lord with perfect hearts,
following Him fully, fearing God and shunning evil.
But the failure in observing the law on man`'s part is due
to the weakness and unprofitableness of the flesh,
so that he many times cannot do the things that he wishes.
And herein the first covenant is found faulty, not in itself, but because of sinful flesh.
And if it had not been so concerning the observance of the first covenant,
a place would not have been found for the second.
Therefore, the works of the first covenant do not obtain life and salvation,
but rather the free grace in the second covenant,
so that now all people might die to themselves according to the flesh,
and live unto God according to the Spirit.^
footnote:[1 Peter 4:6]
Thus life and salvation are not of works but of grace,
in the rich mercy of God through Jesus Christ, who,
in His full and glorious appearance in man, becomes the end of the Law for righteousness,
and brings life and immortality to light by the Gospel.
Here there is no more bondage under the Law because of the weakness of the flesh,
but rather redemption from under it wrought by the power of Christ,
into a more perfect state of freedom and liberty in the life of the Spirit.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What then is signified by the dispensation of the Prophets?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
The nearer approaching or drawing near of Christ in His own fullness and perfect life,
that whereas He is seen but darkly in a glass under the Law,
He may be seen with open face in the complete beauty of His own glory in the Gospel.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Of what service are the Scriptures as they were given forth and recorded outwardly?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
Much in every way unto those who receive the same
Spirit from which they were given forth;
for unto such they are profitable and make wise unto salvation,
and are of service for instruction, edification and comfort.
In these,
the Spirit within receives the testimony of the same
Spirit as it is declared outwardly by the Scriptures,
and there is an agreement and union between the Spirit within, and the words without.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But are they of no further service then as a testimony
of things which were experienced in other times?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The Scriptures were given forth by holy men of God,
through the inspiration of the Almighty, and they testify of Christ, "`who was, and is,
and is to come.`"
And this is their proper service and place: that through their testimony, all people,
both then and now, might come unto Christ to have life.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how does Christ manifest His life,
so that it may be known with certainty to be His?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Christ`'s life is made manifest by His light,
and as the light is loved and received, so the life is also received in it.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Are the light and the life then distinct and separate things?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, the light is Christ, and the life is Christ,
and they are not distinct and separate things.
But Christ is known to be light by His manifesting,
and He is known to be life by His making alive.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
What administration does Christ bring by the appearance
of His own fullness and perfect life?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: He brings an administration of love, grace, and mercy.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And is this administration of love, grace, and mercy for the salvation of men?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, to as many as eagerly look for Him and receive Him in that appearance,
He becomes their salvation;^
footnote:[Hebrews 9:28]
but to such as reject Him, He becomes their condemnation.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is not the administration of Christ universal to all men?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The manifestation of it is universal unto all,
but unbelievers have no part in it as an administration of salvation.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What then is the appearance of Christ`'s love, grace, and mercy,
unto such as reject Him?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It is an administration of judgment,
to cut down and destroy the worker of iniquity, that is,
the contentious and rebellious nature.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
How does Christ appear in both love and judgment in one and the same administration?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: He appears in love to that which tenderly longs and sincerely thirsts after Him,
but in judgment against the obstinate and rebellious
nature that stands in opposition to Him.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How is this administration of the love, grace,
and mercy of Christ to be received?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By acknowledging, uniting with, and submitting to His light in the conscience;
for the light is manifest from His love and life,
and guides all that obey its manifestation up to His love and life.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How does the light manifest itself in order that man may attain life?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
It first manifests itself against everything in man which alienates him from the life.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How is man alienated from the life?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By the power of darkness which rules in him, and leads him captive.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is captivity?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It is the bondage of the seed of God in man.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And what is it that causes bondage and captivity upon the seed of God in man?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The seed of the evil one,
and the begetting and spreading of its unclean nature in man,
from which is produced all the lusts of the heart with which
the holy seed of God is oppressed and burdened.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But does the light of Christ in the conscience make
manifest the very ground or cause of bondage?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for the ground of bondage is darkness, and the light shines in the darkness,
and appears against it, and all the deeds of it.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What is the state of man in bondage?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: A state of grief, sorrow, pain, anguish, tribulation, distress, sighing,
mourning, crying, complaining, heaviness and groaning.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Is this the state of all people that are alienated from the life of Christ?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes,
for man in his fallen and apostate condition lies under the power of darkness,
and the evil deeds of darkness grow together into a body,
which is the body of sin and death that lies upon man,
under which the seed of God travails in affliction and groans to be delivered.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But are not some people joyful while they are alienated from the life of Christ?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The seed of evil may rejoice over the seed of God for a time,
but this joy is also bondage, and it is a joy that must turn into mourning,
and end in sorrow.
And even in the midst of this joy there is sometimes a sense of trouble, fear and pain.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
What are the particular deeds of darkness that oppress and burden the seed of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, inordinate affections, evil desires,
covetousness, drunkenness, pride, anger, malice, envy, hatred, enmity, strife,
foolish jesting, vain communication, vain thoughts, idle words,
praying in the will of the flesh, preaching in the wisdom from below, self-righteousness,
with all other things which are acted by the motion of the flesh,
which are all of a contrary nature to the pure and holy seed of God,
and are the oppression and burden of it.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But how may people know when they are living in such
things as burden and oppress the seed of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By the light of Christ that shines in the conscience,
for the light makes these things manifest to man, and also reproves them.
For there is never a secret thought but what is exposed by the light.
And if the heart intends any evil, the evil can be seen even in the intention,
if a man be only willing.
And that which makes such discoveries is the light, for the apostle says:
"`But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light:
for whatsoever does make manifest is light.`"^
footnote:[Ephesians 5:13 KJV]
Notice he says "`all things,`" and if all things,
then there is nothing that is hidden from it.
It finds out all wandering thoughts, and vain imaginations,
and shows when there is an inclination or an intention
in the heart to do anything that should not be done.
Indeed,
men will sometimes confess that they should not have
such thoughts and intentions stirring in them,
being secretly convinced of the evil of their inclinations,
and stopped from doing what they have an intention to do.
And that which thus secretly discovers, and secretly convinces, is the light of Christ.
Thus the compassion of God manifests itself in the light,
and by it He reaches to the oppressor with rebuke,
and to the oppressed in love and mercy.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is this light a _universal_ manifestation unto all men.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, to all men, without respect of persons.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
What is the reason why God manifests His light and makes such discoveries in man?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The reason for this manifestation is the love of God,
for He is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
Now all who are still in the fall are in a perishing state,
and He therefore manifests His light to convince and reprove the sinner in his way,
that he may turn from his way and live.
Hereby He is manifest to be a gracious and merciful Creator,
in that He desires not the death of a sinner, but instead shows sin to the sinner,
and reproves him for it, that he might thereby forsake it and find mercy.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And is this love received by all unto whom it is so offered?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, for many reject the light,
and will not become subject to its reproofs of instruction; even as Job testifies:
"`There are those who rebel against the light; they do not know its ways,
nor abide in its paths.`"^
footnote:[Job 24:13]
These, by rejecting the light, reject also the love that is offered to them.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Can those who receive His light be freed from sin while still in the body?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, if they love the light which reproves sin, the light will free them from it.
For in the light there is no sin,
and therefore they that join to the light that reproves sin, are guided by it out of sin,
and so come out from under Satan`'s power unto the power of God which takes the sin away.
Hereby the conscience comes to be purged and cleansed from all iniquity and sin,
and the righteousness of Christ is revealed in a new life.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is not the grace of God free through Jesus Christ?
And has not Christ accomplished the work of salvation by Himself alone?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The grace of God is free through Jesus Christ,
and by His light it is freely made manifest and appears unto all,
bringing salvation to all that receive it.
Receiving and obeying this light,
a man will experience all that Christ has accomplished for salvation by Himself alone.
But in this the unbeliever has no share, neither in what Christ has done,
nor in what He is doing.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But if there is a believing in Christ for salvation,
does not His salvation belong unto all, without anything done on their part?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Christ is the Author of true faith,
and none can truly believe until Christ gives them faith in His power,
which He does to all who obey His light.
But the one who applies Christ`'s salvation to himself because
of a human belief in what Christ has accomplished outwardly,
these are not yet in the faith which saves,
but rather in unbelief with respect to His light and power.
For true faith brings salvation by the resurrection of Christ`'s life in man.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How have you come to receive this faith?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By yielding ourselves to the manifestation of the light,
whereby we are drawn and gathered into the nature of it,
and so we receive faith in it as the gift of God.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What then lies on man`'s part in order to experience Christ`'s salvation?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: He is to obey the light and follow it, and so he will grow in faith,
and the light will teach him to deny himself, and to take up the daily cross.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does the light work unto salvation if a man obeys it and follows it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for he that obeys the light and follows it does not abide in darkness,
but comes to the light of life.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Does man have power in himself to turn to the light, and to obey and follow it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, of himself he can do nothing that is good,
nor turn from anything that is evil.
But if he stands still when the light reproves him, he there answers it in obedience,
not joining his will to that which the light reproves him for.
And so by giving diligence to the reproof, and standing still when reproof comes,
he is there in obedience to it,
and then the love of God which is present in that manifestation casts itself about him,
and with its strength it separates him from the sin, and begets a dislike in him unto it,
so that he begins to abhor the appearance of it.
Then, in the strength of the love,
he is enabled to turn from the power of Satan unto the power of God,
where the light becomes his leader and teacher in the way of peace.
Thus salvation is experienced in the light alone, by the power of God alone,
and not by anything which man does of himself.
And yet the light requires man to yield himself to it, and by yielding himself to it,
he answers the requirings of it in obedience, and so becomes a servant of the light,
and a recipient of its power.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What does the light do when man yields himself in this way to serve it?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: It then rises in power,
and is felt to be powerful for pulling down the strongholds of sin,
and dethroning the powers of darkness.
In this way the unclean and corrupt nature comes to be crucified,
the fleshly lusts condemned, and so the burdens, weights and loads are removed,
under which man has travailed and groaned.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is the light sufficient to save man from all sin,
and to present him holy and blameless before God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, it is so; and they that love it know it to be so.
For it is the light of Christ, who has all power in heaven and earth given unto Him,
and there is nothing impossible with Him, nor too hard for Him,
if only man does not reject Him and rebel against His light.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does this power, in its rising, work contrary to man`'s own will, wisdom,
and reason?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for the power of God is a cross unto the will, wisdom and reason of man,
and in all things works contrary to that nature, stopping it, chaining it,
and yoking it down when it desires to be at liberty.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And is this working of God`'s power unto salvation?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, if it is obeyed, so that the opposer is not able to quench it.
For it shows a difference between the precious and the vile within,
and then rises up as a hammer and knocks down the vile,
taking hold of it like a fire and burning it up.
In this way man comes into the furnace where God is felt to be a consuming fire.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But can anyone abide the day of His coming like a refiner`'s fire?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, there are some that do abide it, who love not their lives unto death,
but instead say with Job, "`Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.`"^
footnote:[Job 13:15]

[.discourse-part]
Question: And is salvation wrought through such a dispensation of Christ?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for He is dreadful while wickedness stands in His sight,
and reveals Himself in flaming fire to execute vengeance upon the rebellious nature.
For Christ`'s appearance unto salvation is first an appearance unto judgment upon all,
and against all, that is unwilling that He should reign.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does Christ work this judgment in man?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for sin is in man, and if ever a man will be clean,
Christ must work within him to purge his conscience.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But do none experience Christ to be salvation further
than they feel this work going on within them?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, for you are to understand that while man remains in a fallen state,
he is under the power of darkness,
and therefore the power of Christ must work within him to
subdue the power of darkness that rules over him,
and to save him from the darkness that entangles him.
For this reason, a Christian is to stand continually in the pure fear of God,
and to wait for the appearance of His power to deliver him
out of the snares in which he lies entangled in the darkness.
Then he will feel the working of Christ`'s power in him
to cast out the strong man who has kept the house,
and this power will also keep him in the fear of the Lord, that he dare not sin.
For whoever has truly felt the judgment of the Lord for sin,
learns to live in the pure fear of the Lord,
lest at any time his feet should slip into sin again.
And this is the true love to God, when sin is denied, by which His Holy Spirit is grieved.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
And does the power then work effectually unto salvation as man yields himself to it,
and denies that which it reproves him for?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, it works effectually unto salvation by destroying death in man,
and the reign of him who has the power of death, which is the devil.
For by the work of Christ`'s power, the old man is crucified, with all old works, words,
and thoughts.
These all die in man, and sin is condemned in the flesh,
and the fleshly vessel is brought into subjection and silence.
Man must know this work wrought in him by the power
of God if ever he will know eternal life;
for no unclean thing may enter into the Kingdom of God.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But must a man pass through death and resurrection while he is still in the body?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for unless he is regenerated and born again,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
He must therefore die to the first Adam according to the flesh,
and be quickened and raised in the second Adam according to the Spirit, and so,
living in the resurrection and life, he may enter the kingdom as a little child.
For no part or property of the first Adam can live before God,
but as the second Adam rises in power, the first Adam is put to death.
And here there is experienced a resurrection of the seed,
and man is translated into its nature, receiving a new life, bearing a new image,
and becoming sanctified and blameless in body, soul, and spirit.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But are there none that can please God besides those
who are thus regenerated and born again?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The apostle says, "`Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.`"^
footnote:[Romans 8:8]
Therefore, man must obey the light,
and wait in the power for a new birth that is not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,
which birth of the Spirit is the coming forth of the Father`'s beloved Son,
in whom He is well pleased.

[.discourse-part]
Question: How does the power bring man into death?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By bringing him into stillness, and keeping all fleshly motions in silence,
so that man learns to lie nakedly and innocently before God, as a little child,
and comes to have no will, wisdom,
or reason left in him that has not been baptized down into the death of Christ,
where self is dissolved into nothingness.
Here the power kills and gives life again; and in this way a man lays down his own life,
takes up a new life in Christ, puts on Christ, and is made a new creation.
And in this new life he is then able to serve God, and please God, for his thoughts,
words, and works are all changed, and with a new tongue he sings a new song,
and gives glory, honor, praise, and thanks to Him that sits upon the throne.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But does not the birth of the seed meet with much opposition in its arising?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes,
while it is in the growth and travail it is strongly opposed by a contrary nature,
and there are many dangers that lie near on every hand,
until death has passed upon all that opposes, as has been said before.
But there comes an end to the travail,
when the power has crucified the first Adam throughout,
and the seed is raised into the glorious liberty of its own life.
Then the seed reigns, and has dominion and government over all opposition,
triumphing in victory.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how is the opposition removed,
and the danger escaped in the time of growth and travail?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By faith in the power,
and by watching continually in order to stay close to its leadings.
For when the mind remains on the watch, with faith standing steadfast in the power,
then the enemy has no ability to prevail, though he may tempt.
And then the Lord`'s power (by His own willing and acting) removes opposition,
preserves from danger, goes before as a conqueror, and comes behind as a safeguard.
Thus Christ, by His own power, is all and does all in the travailing babe,
and will not rest any place short of full liberty for His own life.
Therefore, let none enter into unbelief, as if all opposition could never be removed,
nor all dangers be escaped;
for the One who makes alive and causes the soul to breathe after Him, is mighty in power,
and assuredly can save to the uttermost the birth that is of his own begetting.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But may there not be an experience of captivity after
deliverance is in some measure wrought by the power?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, there indeed may be.
For if the mind turns from the power, then unbelief enters,
and there may be a captivity again in those very
places where the power has wrought deliverance.
In this way, many who have had a long travail to come out from Egypt,
and seen great and wonderful things wrought by the power,
who have tasted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
have yet been ensnared again.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But is not the power sufficient to preserve from going astray,
and from returning again into captivity after it has wrought a measure of deliverance?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: The power is just as able to preserve as it is to deliver,
and is not at all weaker in the one than in the other.
And all those who abide in the power, and are guided by the power, do not go astray,
but are kept through faith unto salvation, living in the power,
and receiving strength so that they do not faint.
But the soul returns to captivity when there is not faithfulness to the power,
but instead temptations are allowed to enter and prevail,
so that the mind willingly turns from the power into the temptations.
Hereby a way is opened for the darkness to rise again, which,
in the time of tenderness and faithfulness to the power,
was kept in subjection under the yoke.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does the power follow after these again,
after they turn from it and do not abide faithful to it,
in order to recover them and deliver them out of their captivity?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for the Lord "`waits to be gracious,`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 30:18]
and though there may be a backsliding, yet He does not shut up His compassion,
but extends His hands with a heart of tenderness,
following the wandering sheep that have gone astray,
and by the Word of His power He calls them to return.
And if there is but a yielding to the Word of His power, and a joining to it again,
then the Lord "`heals the backslidings,`"^
footnote:[Jeremiah 3:22]
and loves them as freely as ever He did.
Thus He brings the lost sheep again back into His fold,
gives them pasture amongst His flock,
and there shows His goodness in the riches of His mercy.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
What are the specific dangers that may overtake the
seed while it is in the time of growth and travail?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: There are very many which the light discovers distinctly,
yet I shall here name a few:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ To glory in the flesh because of that which God has given
or made manifest in the time of the soul`'s tenderness.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ To gather the manifestation of truth into the wisdom that is from below,
in order to enrich or exalt the false birth.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ To settle into the outward form or practice of truth,
as it stands in appearance only.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ To lie down contented after something of truth is received.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ To live upon the knowledge of what is seen afar off.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ To enter into unbelief in times of trial and afflictions.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ To run out of the present measure of truth,
and to hunt after the knowledge of it through learning and comprehension.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ To feed upon anything that does not flow from the
immediate opening and springing of the life.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ To form an imagination of security,
and then to lie down in it as a place of rest.

====

These with many more (all of which can be seen in the light) are great
dangers and temptations that lie very near to man in the time of travail.
And if at any time the will does but join to them,
the seed is thereby brought into captivity,
even after there has been a great deliverance from Egypt.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
How may one keep in the safe path throughout the entire time of growth and travail,
and escape such dangers as these?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By turning to and abiding in the everlasting power of Christ,
and living by faith in it.
For this power is a cross unto man`'s own will, and stops Nimrod`'s hunting nature,
chaining down all unruly affections.
And as the mind abides in the power, all dangers are escaped,
and the innocent babe is safely preserved out of the hands of its enemies.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Where must the soul abide in order to be preserved safe in the whole of its journey?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ In lowness and humility of mind.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ In poverty and nakedness.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ In nothingness and emptiness.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ In simplicity and innocency.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ In integrity and sincerity.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ In faith and patience.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ In the measure of power received.

====

These with many more (all of which can be understood in the light)
are places where the power overshadows the birth of the seed,
and acts as a sure defense to it, preserving it out of all dangers.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But when the Lord opens and gives a clear sight of the life,
is it not then safe to reach unto it, and take hold of it into possession?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Oh no, beware of that!
For if you reach forth to lay hold of what may be seen of the life,
then that which opens it to your view will immediately shut
up and retreat back into its own perfect nature and fullness.
And then the enemy will often transform himself into
the likeness of what was first truly opened by Lord,
and will present a false likeness that the reaching
part of man will lay hold of with his eager desires,
catching the likeness but missing the true substance.
Therefore, whenever the Lord opens and gives a true sight of the life,
and an innocent thirst is felt after its spring or fountain,
then you must keep silent in the fear of the Lord,
so that the One who opens may also lay hold of the one who thirsts,
bringing him into a greater experience of the fullness.
For the life must gather into itself the one that thirsts, and not the other way around.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Is not that which has been tasted and felt to be
for consolation and refreshing at one time,
good for the same use and service at another time?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: If it comes fresh from the spring, it is.
But if it has already been tasted and felt, then it is not.
For the babe must continually have fresh milk for its consolation
and refreshment whenever it stands in need;
but milk that has been tasted, felt, and digested, is no longer good for nourishment.
Therefore, the babe is always to depend upon the fountain of its birth, and there,
waiting in silence and in pure fear,
all that is good for food will be given to it according to its need.
Thus, the new birth lives by new food, and the fountain is preserved sweet and clean,
and pure consolation and refreshing are ministered by the life to the hungry ones.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
And can a state of true rest and peace be attained by the
consolation and refreshing that comes from the life?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, the babe lies down in peace, and through nourishment and rest,
it grows up more and more into the perfect man,
to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, becoming strong in the Lord.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
And what is the disposition of a man who has grown to the
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: His disposition is love, mercy, gentleness, meekness, peace, justice, equity,
uprightness, sincerity, innocency, and simplicity,
in which he bears the heavenly image of Christ in His own perfect nature,
and in heavenly wisdom towards God and men.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does pure religion consist in the manifestation of these virtues and graces?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Pure religion consists in the power and wisdom of God,
and these virtues and graces are indeed manifestations of pure religion,
being the effects of it, which spread abroad as natural branches from the Root of life.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
And do all things become new in man after he is thus changed through regeneration?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes,
when all the old is dead and buried by the resurrection and reign of the seed,
then all things become new in man.
For the new birth has new thoughts, new works, new words, and a new tongue.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Does the new birth have any agreement with the old in any way?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, that is not possible, for they are contrary to each other in all things,
arising from contrary seeds, and there is no agreement between them.

[.discourse-part]
Question: What manifestations are produced from the evil seed?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
They are those things which are generally observed in those who are unregenerated,
who are people of the world, or worldly people.
For it is the evil seed which rules in the world, producing the lusts of the flesh,
the lusts of the eyes, and the pride of life.
These are not of the Father, but of the world.^
footnote:[1 John 2:16]

[.discourse-part]
Question:
Can those who are born of the seed of God join with
the people of the world in such things?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, here lies another impossibility, for they are born of another nature,
and there is no agreement between contraries, either in nature or in manifestation.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And does not the world, or the birth of the flesh,
despise and hate the birth born of God,
because it cannot conform to what is done in that nature?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, and also persecutes it, which is the ground of great envy, strife,
and outward persecution and affliction.
For that which is born of God delights to do the will of God,
but that which is born of the will of man is contrary to it, despises it,
and manifests great enmity towards it.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Do those who are born of God endure persecution without resisting or revenging?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, for they suffer in the will of God,
and so lay down in patience and quietness,
where they find true contentment and peace in all that comes
to pass through their various trials and afflictions.
And God does most wonderfully appear in and with His own birth in those
who suffer trials and afflictions for their faithfulness to Him.
Indeed, He appears in His endless love, mercy, and goodness,
and often breaks forth in tenderness unto His afflicted children,
giving them strength to stand in every trial that comes upon them.

[.discourse-part]
Question: And what do trials and afflictions work for those who are exercised in them?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: They work for much good in every way,
for by them a man comes to see his own nothingness and emptiness,
and is brought into humility of mind to wait upon God for the renewing
of His strength that he may not grow weary or faint.

[.discourse-part]
Question: Then should a man desire to be exercised in outward afflictions?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Man is not to make his own choice in anything,
but rather to stand in the will of God;
and if for the exercise of his conscience towards God afflictions do result,
then he will feel it work for much good.
But choosing affliction in his own will will not bring any comfort.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how is it that you came to the knowledge and understanding of these things?

[.discourse-part]
Answer:
By the light which has shone in our hearts to give us the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 4:6]

[.discourse-part]
Question: How do you know that it is a true light which gives you such a knowledge?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: By the operation and effects of it, and by its fruits.
For by the strength of its power in us,
all that knowledge which we formerly gained through
human comprehending begins to decay and die,
and a loss comes upon all that has been gathered by the power of earthly wisdom.
Then there is a crucifying of that nature in us which has rebelled against God,
and the fruits of love, mercy, meekness, gentleness, peace, longsuffering, patience,
righteousness and holiness spring up from the true faith.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But can none experience these things but those who are of your opinion?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: We are not of any opinion, but are of the seed of life,
by which we are saved and receive life.
In this we stand, not in any opinion, but in the experience of life and salvation.
For all opinions stand in notions and apprehensions gathered into the natural part,
where a man can experience nothing of life and salvation.
And by putting his faith in such things, he cannot help but err from the life.

[.discourse-part]
Question:
But do you judge all to be in unbelief that are not just as you are in all things?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: No, we do not judge so, for we believe that in every nation,
he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of Him.^
footnote:[Acts 10:35]
And we also believe that none can fear God and work righteousness, or be accepted of Him,
except as they are in some measure guided by the
seed of His light and life in their conscience,
and have some faith in it towards God.
And we believe that many in some small measure do thus fear God, and work righteousness,
though they do not clearly understand the seed, or gift of grace,
by which they are drawn to do it.
Such we do not judge to be in unbelief,
but rather have unity with them in that measure of
faith in which they long after God in simplicity,
and according to their understanding walk in His fear, and serve Him in righteousness.
And though such are not just as we are in all things,
yet being in any measure guided by the seed of Christ to fear God and work righteousness,
we truly love them, and feel tenderness towards them,
and desire that in that seed they may grow in faith, and become as we are in all things.

[.discourse-part]
Question: But how may people come to be satisfied that it is with you as you say it is.
For there are others who may say just as much for
themselves and for their way as you do for yours.

[.discourse-part]
Answer: There is no other way for anyone to be satisfied in this matter,
but by taking heed to the seed or gift of grace in themselves.
For, because we are born of God, none can be satisfied concerning us,
either in our principles or practice,
except as they come to the same life in which we live.
If people desire only to reason about things that differ,
they may weary themselves and yet never be satisfied.
But we do not only say that it is so with us,
and then insist that others believe it barely from our saying so,
but rather we call all people to join with the same
light and power of Christ within them,
and if they come unto that,
then we know that what we are shall be made manifest to their consciences,
even as Paul says:
"`But by manifestation of the truth we commend ourselves
to every man`'s conscience in the sight of God.`"^
footnote:[2 Corinthians 4:2]
And so it is not what we or any others may say about
us that can give true satisfaction to an enquirer,
but what the Witness of God in the conscience says;
for if that does not confirm what is said,
there is nothing else that can clearly evidence the matter in question.
And if the Witness of God in the heart does not substantiate what we say,
then let us not be believed; but if it be otherwise,
then all may be satisfied that we are not only sayers, but also doers.

Therefore, if any would be satisfied concerning us in anything,
they must find us and know us in the seed of life where we are,
and not in their own reason where we are not;
for it is not possible to find a man where he is not,
or to know him until he be found and beheld in the place where he lives.
So let all cease from reasoning about us,
for in that way they can never know us or come to us.
But rather, let all feel after the gift of God in themselves,
and learn to be faithful to it,
and they will no longer say that '`the Quaker`'s religion has recently sprung up,
and we do not know or understand their doctrines,`' but will instead
see that our religion is as old as Christ`'s life and light,
which now appears in us, and so all doubts and questions will be removed.

[.discourse-part]
Question: So you refer the proof of all that you are, and say, and do,
to the same seed in others, which you say is Christ, the light, the life,
and the witness of God?

[.discourse-part]
Answer: Yes, we do.
For as we know that all judgement in heaven and earth is committed unto Christ,
so there is not another that can truly try or judge us besides Him,
and therefore we have boldness to refer our trial in all things unto Him alone,
according to the manifestation of His truth in every man.
And we also know that He will not condemn the work of His own hands,
but rather justify the fruit of His own life, power and virtue,
and His trial and judgement will clearly evidence for us, that we are His,
and not our own.
